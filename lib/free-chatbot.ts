**Key Features:**
â€¢ Object-oriented programming
â€¢ Memory management control
â€¢ High performance and efficiency
â€¢ Rich standard library
â€¢ Cross-platform compatibility

**Basic Example:**
\`\`\`cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    cout << "Hello, World!" << endl;
    return 0;
}
\`\`\`

Would you like to learn about specific C++ concepts like variables, functions, or classes?`;

**In C++:**
\`\`\`cpp
int age = 25;           // integer variable
string name = "John";   // string variable
double price = 19.99;   // decimal variable
bool isActive = true;   // boolean variable
\`\`\`

**Key Points:**
â€¢ Variables have names (identifiers)
â€¢ They can store different data types
â€¢ Values can be changed during program execution
â€¢ Must be declared before use

Would you like to learn about different data types or variable naming conventions?`;

**In C++:**
\`\`\`cpp
int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}

// Using the function
int result = add(5, 3); // result = 8
\`\`\`

**Key Benefits:**
â€¢ **Reusability** - write once, use many times
â€¢ **Organization** - break complex tasks into smaller parts
â€¢ **Maintainability** - easier to update and debug
â€¢ **Testing** - can test individual functions

Would you like to learn about different types of functions or parameters?`;
    }

**Types of Loops in C++:**

1. **For Loop** - when you know how many times to repeat:
\`\`\`cpp
for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    cout << "Count: " << i << endl;
}
\`\`\`

2. **While Loop** - repeat while a condition is true:
\`\`\`cpp
int count = 0;
while (count < 3) {
    cout << "Count: " << count << endl;
    count++;
}
\`\`\`

**When to use loops:**
â€¢ Processing lists of data
â€¢ Repeating calculations
â€¢ Automating repetitive tasks

Would you like examples of more complex loop scenarios?`;
    }
    
    if (lowerMessage.includes('array')) {
      return `An **array** is a collection of items stored in a single variable.

string fruits[3] = {"apple", "banana", "orange"};

// Accessing elements (index starts at 0)
cout << numbers[0]; // prints 1
cout << fruits[1];  // prints "banana"

// Looping through arrays
for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    cout << numbers[i] << " ";
}
\`\`\`

**Key Concepts:**
â€¢ Index starts at 0 (first element is at position 0)
â€¢ Arrays can store different data types
â€¢ Size must be declared when creating the array
â€¢ Many built-in methods for manipulation

Would you like to learn about array operations and algorithms?`;

1. **Active Recall** - Test yourself instead of just re-reading
2. **Spaced Repetition** - Review material at increasing intervals
3. **Interleaving** - Mix different topics in one study session
4. **Elaboration** - Explain concepts in your own words
5. **Dual Coding** - Combine words with visual aids

**Pro Tips:**
â€¢ Study in 25-minute focused sessions (Pomodoro Technique)
â€¢ Create your own examples and analogies
â€¢ Teach the material to someone else
â€¢ Get enough sleep - it helps memory consolidation
â€¢ Stay hydrated and take regular breaks
